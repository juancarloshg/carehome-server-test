# carehome-server-test

Test server for the [CareHomeInfo project](https://github.com/civicreactor/CareHomeInfo)

See live [here](http://carehome-app-test.herokuapp.com/)

This version is not up to date. New changes have been made, mostly improving styles and compressing the web files (this one is sending really big files).

Also, note that there is no back-end yet, so all the data is coming from JSON files. That requires you to download all the care homes even if you only want to see one.
